		<h1><strong>About Me</strong></h1>
		<p>My name is <em>Logan Gauruder</em>. I'm a Latter Day Saint who has lived in a handful of states in the US: Idaho, Missouri, and Utah. I'm studying here at BYU and this website will help you to get to know me a little better.</p>
		<h3><strong>Religion</strong></h3>
		<p>First of all is religion. My faith has been a strong driving force for my life. I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints born to two Latter Day Saint parents in Southern Idaho. I went on a Latter Day Saint mission to Dallas, TX and spoke Spanish while there. I love the Lord Jesus Christ and I strive to allow religious principles to guide my life.</p>
		<h3><strong>Education</strong></h3>
		<p>Education is important to me and attending Brigham Young University has always been a life goal of mine. Now I'm here studying for a Bachelor's in Cybersecurity. It's been a long road of planning and following academic interests and I hope my vision for the future will continue to develop in the coming years. I'm very interested in computers, people interacting with them (including Artificial Intelligence), and ways to keep critical data secure in the digital world.</p>
		<h3><strong>Hobbies</strong></h3>
		<p>I enjoy a variety of hobbies from reading to writing novels to playing videos games and much more. Athletically, I'm a runner and I hope to be well-trained enough to run an ultra-marathon. I also enjoy triathlon and have been able to do a short one in the past and hope to run a full Ironman in the near future. I like to play video games when I'm not doing school work or exercising and that ranges from PC games to Xbox. Lately, I find myself without too much free time so I'm mostly working or studying.</p>
